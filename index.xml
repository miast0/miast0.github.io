      <description>UofTCTF 2024 forensics/Illusion Writeup We&amp;rsquo;re given a PCAP file with a lot of traffic to and from one IP address. Looking into it, its mainly http traffic, with some calls to a cloned Google.com page, and a get request for an image. The requests to the images caught my interest, as they don&amp;rsquo;t return any image data, just a 200OK.
The GUID string looks like base64, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t decode to anything.</description>

      <description>Hello World Hello!
My name is Miasto, I&amp;rsquo;m a security researcher based in Ireland. Currently my research areas are focused around Cyber Resilience, but I&amp;rsquo;ve previously done research on P2P Botnets and IoT malware, and different emerging threats.
I&amp;rsquo;m an avid competitor in CTFs, representing team Ireland in the ECSC and WorldSkills. I regularly compete in online CTFs, mainly focusing in forensics, rev and misc.
I plan to use this blog as a way to publicse any write ups and research, as well as to just get used to writting.</description>
